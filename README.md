#Short Description
The VIT Q-Less platform is a comprehensive digital solution engineered to resolve the systemic inefficiencies associated with physical queuing and appointment management at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT). By leveraging a robust web-based architecture, the platform offers a streamlined, user-centric interface for students to manage their engagement with key campus services, thereby converting unproductive waiting time into a period of enhanced academic and personal productivity. This project addresses a critical operational bottleneck, providing a scalable and data-driven framework for improving campus-wide service delivery.

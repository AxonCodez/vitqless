# VIT Q-Less:
A descriptive repository about our teams idea submission for DevJams'25

### Short Description
The VIT Q-Less platform is a comprehensive digital solution engineered to resolve the inefficiencies associated with physical queuing and appointment management at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT).The platform offers a streamlined, user-centric interface for students to manage their engagement with key campus services, thereby converting unproductive waiting time into a period of enhanced academic and personal productivity.

### Problem Statement:
The core problem is that students at VIT Vellore waste time and face frustration due to inefficient systems for queuing and booking appointments for common campus services.
Current campus ecosystem consists of a major flaw, long physical waiting queues at high-traffic service points such as messes, administrative offices, HOD rooms, Proctor cabins, etc

### Proposed Solution:
VIT Q-Less is a full-stack web application cum mobile app designed to digitize and optimize campus service interactions. The solution is modular, scalable, and built on a modern technology stack to ensure performance and reliability. This solution adaptively stands as a solution to the given problem statement

### Features:
Student Interface: A responsive web application accessible via any browser. It features a unified dashboard that provides real-time service status, virtual queuing functionality, and an integrated appointment booking system.

Staff Interface: A secure, data-driven web portal that allows administrators to manage and monitor service flow. It provides controls to advance queues, view scheduled appointments, and access a simplified data view for resource planning.

Unified Service Dashboard:

A single-screen mobile app listing the top 3-4 most problematic services, which could be:

The largest mess hall (e.g., SJA or TT)

The Student Affairs office

The main library desk (for book check-out/in)

Each service will have a card showing a simple status: "Open" or "Closed." There will be no live queue data yet, just a button to access the next step.

Basic Live Queue and Appointment System:

Queueing Module (for Mess Hall):

A simple interface showing a button to "Get a Token."

Upon tapping, the student receives a single, sequential number (e.g., #54).

A counter on the screen shows "Now Serving: #51." This counter is manually updated by a staff member on a separate simple interface.

No notifications, no estimated wait times. The student simply sees their token number and the current serving number.

Appointment Module (for Student Affairs):

A basic booking page showing a fixed number of available time slots for the day (e.g., 10:00 AM, 10:30 AM, etc.).

The student can tap to book an open slot. Once booked, it becomes unavailable.

The student gets a confirmation message with the date and time.

No calendar sync or automated reminders.

Basic Staff-Facing Portal:

A single web page or a simple app for each service provider.

For the queueing service (Mess Hall), it has a list of active tokens and a big "Serve Next" button.

For the appointment service (Student Affairs), it shows a list of booked appointments for the day.
